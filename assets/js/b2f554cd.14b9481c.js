Why it took that long, don\'t ask me. All this really proved was that the official cluster will be at least three nodes.\\n\\n## Changes in The Update\\n\\n### New Features\\n\\n- Account Recovery (Yes I Know Email Still Does Not Work On the Canary)\\n- Added Error Page\\n- Added Dashboard (Kinda)\\n\\n### Changes\\n\\n- Added Output for Registration and Login\\n- Removed FNF OG From Home Page As It Longer Is Supported\\n\\n### Bug Fixes\\n\\n- Fixed Weird Bug That Rarely Happens On Game Page"},{"id":"canary-deployment","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/canary-deployment","editUrl":"https://github.com/fnfcentral/fnfcentral.com/edit/main/docs/blog/blog/2021-12-20-canary-deployment/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-20-canary-deployment/index.md","title":"Canary Initial Deployment","description":"Canary?","date":"2021-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 20, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":0.575,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph (JRed)","title":"Creator of FNF Central","url":"https://github.com/jredow","imageURL":"https://github.com/jredow.png","key":"jred"}],"prevItem":{"title":"0.0.5 Release and First Outage","permalink":"/blog/0.0.5-and-outages"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome To The FNF Docs!","permalink":"/blog/welcome-to-docs"}},"content":"## Canary?\\n\\nTo test everything, we deploy a small test site just like the main server to make sure everything goes okay.
